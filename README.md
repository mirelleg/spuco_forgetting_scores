Exploring Forgetting Scores and Spurious Correlations


I investigated this project of exploring forgetting scores and spurious correlations as a group project with other group members. With this being a group project, it was important that everyone contributed equally, which I worked on the evaluation, calculating forgettability and the heatmap portion of the project. From my knowledge, this is a project/intersection of topics that has not been explored into much, which is why we pursued it. Due to privacy reasons, I have kept my other group project members and other co-authors of the report as Author 1, Author 3, Author 4.
